### Goals:

From this dataset, our project is planning on analyzing various changes in the popularity of destinations, the frequency and population of these flights, and their changes over time. Specifically, we are currently planning on observing the impact of major events on the population that chooses to fly, determining the most popular vacation destinations, along with the times of the year that they are popular, and creating a program that predicts how popular a flight will be from one destination to another during a given month.
